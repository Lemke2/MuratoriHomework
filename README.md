Casey provides input files in binary, which I download from his github, then run through the NASMtoString java main class, which provides me the same input in txt files which I use to do homeworks.

I find it easier to reason about it this way instead of wasting time on doing it in one function, when the point is the to understand how the CPU works, not how to parse binary files.
