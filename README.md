First homework was learning how the assembler decodes binary to assembly instructions, only register to register movs. Finished in Java.

Second homework was start of simulating executing the assembler instructions. Starting with basic register-immediate movs(43), adding support for register to register movs later(44).

Switched to cpp to learn the language :D
